# Welcome to CryptoHFT!

CryptoHFT is a software that lets you trade automatically on Binance using an high-frequency-trading like algorithm. 
I'm building it mainly because I think it's a great way to learn what is high frequency trading and how it works.

**Note that this is not a commercial application, use it at your own risk.**
